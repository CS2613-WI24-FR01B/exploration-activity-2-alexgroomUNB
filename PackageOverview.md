I selected JavaScript's [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

Chart.js is one of the most popular JavaScript charting software.

### 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
Chart.js offers a variety of chart types to easily visualize data in an appealing way. A Chart object is created with clear parameters making it easy to use. Some built-in chart/graph types include bar, pie, and scatter among several others, however, alongside the built-in charts, Chart.js allows users to develop [community-maintained chart types](https://github.com/chartjs/awesome#charts) as well. Chart.js provides a responsive functionality with its charts by default in which they will automatically resize to fit its container [1].


### 4. When was it created?
Under *Why Chart.js* on their website, "Chart.js was created and announced in 2013 but has come a long way since then. Itâ€™s open-source, licensed under the very permissive MIT license , and maintained by an active community."[1].

### 5. Why did you select this package/library?
I selected Chart.js as it is highly popular and therefore very well maintained with good documentation. Creating the charts was quite straightforward with clear parameters and aesthetically pleasing results.

## Streamlit
### 1. Which package/library did you select?

For my second library, I selected Python's [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

### 2. What is the package/library?
Streamlit is a library that turns data scripts into shareable apps (or web apps) all in Python code [2].

### 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
Streamlit allows web apps to be created with Python scripts. When a user runs their streamlit app through their command prompt, streamlit spins up a locally hosted server for the web app to operate on. Streamlit has an extensive [library](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) that contains documentation for each of its many interactive widgets. These widgets range from text display, user input, containers, charts, and several more. Streamlit allows both embedded html and markdown into the Python script for simple multi-language integration.


### 4. When was it created?
Streamlit was first released in October of 2019 [4].

### 5. Why did you select this package/library?
I chose streamlit as I am most comfortable with writing Python code. This allowed me to design a visually appealing web app with much less difficulty than using a JavaScript library such as React. Streamlit is also a very new and innovative library with very good documentation, lots of example code, and a large community.
