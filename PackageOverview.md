Some built-in chart/graph types include bar, pie, and scatter among several others, however, alongside the built-in charts, Chart.js allows users to develop [community-maintained chart types](https://github.com/chartjs/awesome#charts) as well. Chart.js provides a responsive functionality with its charts by default in which they will automatically resize to fit its container [1].


### 4. When was it created?
Under *Why Chart.js* on their website, "Chart.js was created and announced in 2013 but has come a long way since then. Itâ€™s open-source, licensed under the very permissive MIT license , and maintained by an active community."[1].

I selected Chart.js as it is highly popular and therefore very well maintained with good documentation. Creating the charts was quite straightforward with clear parameters and aesthetically pleasing results.

Using Chart.js allowed me to become more familiar with JavaScript objects and data manipulation. 


### 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
Using Chart.js was an overall good experience, it provides sufficient documentation to easily learn its functionality and apply it to your desired program. 


## Streamlit
### 1. Which package/library did you select?

For my second library, I selected Python's [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

### 2. What is the package/library?
Streamlit is a library that turns data scripts into shareable apps (or web apps) all in Python code [2].

### 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
Streamlit allows web apps to be created with Python scripts. When a user runs their streamlit app through their command prompt, streamlit spins up a locally hosted server for the web app to operate on. Streamlit has an extensive [library](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) that contains documentation for each of its many interactive widgets. These widgets range from text display, user input, containers, charts, and several more. Streamlit allows both embedded html and markdown into the Python script for simple multi-language integration.


### 4. When was it created?
Streamlit was first released in October of 2019 [4].

### 5. Why did you select this package/library?
I chose streamlit as I am most comfortable with writing Python code. This allowed me to design a visually appealing web app with much less difficulty than using a JavaScript library such as React. Streamlit is also a very new and innovative library with very good documentation, lots of example code, and a large community. 


### 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
Using Streamlit enhanced my ability to handle user input in Python with regard to using dictionaries, as well as reading and writing to JSON files. 
The immediate visual responses provided by Streamlit enabled me to understand Python programming through a practical application.


### 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
My overall experience was great. Being able to use a language I was comfortable to perform a task I had never done before (creating a web app) was very helpful in my learning process. Streamlit has great documentation and I highly reccommend using it for anyone trying to get into web dev.
